# Python-2DGame
I am creating a 2D Python game using pygame. I want to create a game that connects to a server (which I will be running on a Raspberry Pi) to play against other players.

## Installation

Make sure you have Python 3 installed. You can download it [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

Next you need to install pygame. You can do it by entering the following into terminal:

```bash
pip install pygame
```

(You will need to have [pip](https://pypi.org/project/pip/) installed for this to work)

## Usage

Simply run the Python file using:
```bash
python3 main.py
```

(this is outdated and I will need to update it soon)
